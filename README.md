# psybot
This project is conducted for IYKRA Solver Society Program. Me and the team tried to develop chatbot prototype named PsyBot that can detect depression from a text. Further, PsyBot is expected to be not only a companion for those who have a depressive tendency, but also can be a professional help in the future.
